# This script checks out a git repository with the correct revision for
# execution in AWS CodeBuild when triggered by AWS CodePipeline and produces a
# source archive.
# The script assumes that you have the following environment variables set:
# * CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION - Set automatically when AWS CodePipeline
#   invokes AWS CodeBuild
# * GIT_REMOTE - A valid git remote that will be cloned
# This script is meant to be triggered only from branch-based executions of the
# pipeline.  It does not handle pull requests.
